## 🚀 Launch Saraphina

Double-click: **Launch Saraphina.bat** on your desktop

Or run:
```bash
python "D:\Saraphina Root\saraphina_terminal_ultra.py"
```

## 🧪 Test the New Features

Try these to see her curiosity in action:

### 1. Test Auto-Research
```
You: What do you know about Kubernetes?
```
**Watch for:**
- 🔍 "I don't know much about this yet. Let me learn..."
- ✅ "Learned 10 new facts about Kubernetes"
- ✨ "+20.0 XP from research"
- 💾 "Stored as memory #..."

### 2. Test Curious Questions
```
You: I'm learning Python
```
**She might ask:**
- "What aspects of Python interest you most?"
- "Are you learning it for a specific project?"
- "What's your programming background?"

**Watch for:**
- ✨ "+1.0 XP in programming (curious!)"  ← The bonus!

### 3. Test Conversation Memory
```
You: I work with Docker
[wait for response]
You: What's the best orchestration tool?
```
**She'll remember** you mentioned Docker and give contextual advice about Kubernetes!
